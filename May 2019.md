    **Answer**: ___F___
    
2. A `SIGSEGV` signal is sent when a process tries to access an invalid memory address.  
    **Answer**: ___T___
    
3. Assuming `prog` is a valid program in your current working directory and the call to `execl` is successful, the statement `"Done running prog"` will be the last message printed to stdout by this fragment of code:
    
    ```c
    printf("Start running prog\n");
    execl("./prog", "prog", NULL);
    printf("Done running prog\n");
    ```
    
    **Answer**: __T____
    
4. A server process uses the same socket descriptor to read from and write to all of its clients.  
    **Answer**: ___T___
    
5. Given `int x = 4;` and `int y = 8;`, the expressions `(x & y)` and `(x && y)` will evaluate to different values.  
    **Answer**: ___T___
    
6. A client’s `connect()` call will only return successfully after the server has called `accept()` for this client.  
    **Answer**: ___T___
    
7. When a process calls `execl`, a new process with different process id runs the program specified by the first argument.  
    **Answer**: __F__
    
8. Attempting to read from a pipe that is closed for writing will result in a `SIGPIPE` signal being sent.  
    **Answer**: ___F___

    **Answer**: ___T___
    
10. The current working directory contains files named `apple` and `banana`. When the following shell program is run with command line arguments `cat` and `dog`, the output will be `apple` and `banana` on separate lines:
    
    ```sh
    for i in $*; do
      echo $i
    done
    ```
    
    **Answer**: ___F___

## Question 2 (4 Marks)

Your current working directory contains only two C source files and a header file named `prog.c`, `lib.c`, and `lib.h` respectively. The `prog.c` file has a `main` function and calls functions from `lib.c`.

**(a)** Write a Makefile rule so that the object file `lib.o` is created only if at least one of the files `lib.c` and `lib.h` has been modified. Note that the program should be compiled with debugging symbols enabled.

```make
# lib.o rule
lib.o: lib.c lib.h

...
```

**(b)** Write a Makefile rule so that the object file `prog.o` is created only if `prog.c` has been modified. Note that the program should be compiled with the flag to display all warning messages.

```make
# prog.o rule
prog.o: prog.c
...
```

**(c)** Write a Makefile rule so that when you type `make prog`, the final executable `prog` is created only if at least one of `lib.o` or `prog.o` has been modified.

```make
# prog rule
prog: lib.o prog.o
...
```

**(d)** We want the program `prog` to be compiled or updated when we type `make` with no arguments. Explain what we need to do to the Makefile, including any new rules that might need to be created so that this will work.

> **Answer**: _________________________________________________make: all__

## Question 3 (7 Marks)

Some code fragments below have a problem. For each fragment, indicate whether the code works as intended or there is an error. If the code does not compile, check **COMPILE ERROR** and explain why. If the code compiles without errors, but running the program might cause an error (runtime or logical), check **ERROR** and explain why. Otherwise, check **NO ERROR** and write the result of the print statement.

**(a)**

```c
char str[] = "CSC209";
char *s = "CSC209S";
s[6] = '\0';
printf("%d\n", strcmp(str, s));
```

-  COMPILE ERROR Reason: __________________
    
-  ERROR Reason: __________________
    

**(b)**

```c
int x;
int *p = &x;
printf("%d\n", *p);
```

-  NO ERROR Result: _____
    
-  COMPILE ERROR Reason: __________________
    
-  ERROR Reason: _________x not assigned yet, pointer p doesn't print anything_________
    

**(c)**

```c
int arr[5] = {1,2,3,4,5};
int *p = arr[2];
printf("%d\n", *p);
```

-  ERROR Reason: __________________
    

**(e)**

```c
char str[] = "Welcome to CSC209!";
char s[16] = "Hello!";
strncat(s, str, 15);
printf("%s\n", s);
```

-  NO ERROR Result: _____
    
-  COMPILE ERROR Reason: ______doesn't fit____________
    
-  ERROR Reason: __________________
    

**(f)**

```c
char *get_extension(char *str) {
  char ext[4];
  char *p;
  if ((p = strchr(str, '.')) != NULL) {
    strncpy(ext, p, 4);
    ext[3] = '\0';
    return ext;
  } else {
    return NULL;
  }
}
printf("%s\n", get_extension("run.c"));
```

-  NO ERROR Result: _____
    
-  COMPILE ERROR Reason: __________________
    
-  ERROR Reason: __________________
    

**(g)**

```c
void build_reverse(char *src, char *dest) {
  int i, j;
  for (i = strlen(src), j = 0; i > 0; i--, j++)
    dest[j] = src[i];
  dest[j] = '\0';
}
char t[6];
char *s = "World";
build_reverse(s, t);
printf("%s\n", t); // Prints dlroW
```

-  NO ERROR Result: ____dlroW_

## Question 4 (5 Marks)

The purpose of the following function is to add a new item at the beginning of a linked list. However, the function does not work properly. First, identify two problems with the implementation. Second, correctly implement the function without modifying its return value; you may change the parameters.

```c
struct node {
  int value;
  struct node *next;
};

void list_insert_head(struct node *head, int val) {
  struct node p;
  p.value = val;
  p.next = head;
  head = &p;
}
```

- **First problem**: _______________________________p.next = head_
    
- **Second problem**: ____struct node p__________________________
    

**Correct implementation**:

```c
void list_insert_head(/* parameters */) {
  struct node *p;
  p.value = val;
  p->next = head;
  head = &p;
}
```

## Question 5 (8 Marks)

Consider the memory diagram below. Complete the code to match the diagram. As always, your program should free any heap-allocated memory.

```c
char *reverse(char *s) {
  int len = strlen(s);
  char *rev = malloc(sizeof(char)*len)
  while (i = 0; i<len i++) {
	  rev[len-i-1] = s[i];
  }
  return rev;
}

int main() {
  char fruit = 'bananas';
  char str = reverse(banana);
  free(str);
  return 0;
}
```

_(Memory diagram referenced on exam page – reproduce on paper.)_

## Question 6 (7 Marks)

A binary file contains an array of `struct record` entries followed by name data. Implement the function `get_record_name` that returns the name for a given record id or `NULL` if not found.

```c
#define NUM_RECS 4
struct record {
  int id;
  int len;
  int offset;
};

char *get_record_name(char *filename, int rec_id) {
  // ____________________________________________
}
```

---

## Question 7 (6 Marks)

Write a function `do_fork` that forks child processes and prints elements of an array in a linear chain.

```c
void do_fork(char **data, int size) {
  // ____________________________________________
  getpid();
  int max = size
  if (size != 1) {
  fork();
  printf(data[max - size])
  do_fork(data, size);
  }
}

int main() {
  char *instruments[3] = {"guitar", "piano", "violin"};
  do_fork(instruments, 3);
  return 0;
}
```

Expected output order:

```
parent: pid=...,
child1: pid=..., ppid=..., guitar
child2: pid=..., ppid=..., piano
child3: pid=..., ppid=..., violin
```

## Question 8 (4 Marks)

Consider a program where the parent forks a single child and uses a pipe between them.

**(a)** Explain what happens when the child calls `read` before the parent has written anything to the pipe.

> **Answer**: ________compile error__________________________

**(b)** Suppose the child exits before reading all of the data that the parent is writing. Explain the effect on the parent.

> **Answer**: __________________________________

**(c)** Suppose the parent does not close the pipe write descriptor. Does the program terminate normally? Explain.

> **Answer**: __________________________________

**(d)** Explain the circumstances under which the write call in the parent could block.

> **Answer**: __________________________________

## Question 10 (7 Marks)

Identify three significant bugs in the server code fragment below and describe them. Then fix the bugs in the code on the next page.

```c
// Initialization
for (i = 0; i < MAXCLIENTS; i++)
  client[i] = -1;

fd_set fds;
FD_ZERO(&fds);
FD_SET(listenfd, &fds);
int maxfd = listenfd;

while (1) {
  int nready = select(maxfd+1, &fds, NULL, NULL, NULL);

  if (FD_ISSET(listenfd, &fds)) {
    connfd = accept(listenfd, (struct sockaddr *)&cliaddr, &clilen);
    for (i = 0; i < MAXCLIENTS; i++)
      if (client[i] < 0) {
        client[i] = connfd;
        break;
      }
    FD_SET(connfd, &fds);
  }

  for (i = 0; i < MAXCLIENTS; i++) {
    sockfd = client[i];
