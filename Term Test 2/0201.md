Below are thorough, step-by-step explanations of each solution in the TermTest2-L0201 solutions PDF.  
  
---

## Question 1 (6 marks)\

### (a) Zombie process (2 marks)\

**Definition**: A _zombie process_ is a child process that has terminated (either by returning from `main` or by calling `exit`) but still occupies an entry in the operating system’s process table. This happens because the parent process has not yet called `wait()` or `waitpid()` to read the child’s exit status.\

**Removal conditions**:\

1. **Parent calls `wait()` or `waitpid()`**: When the parent invokes one of these functions, the kernel makes the child’s exit status available and reclaims the process table entry, removing the zombie.\
    
2. **Parent terminates before waiting**: If the parent exits without reaping its child, the child is re-parented to the special `init` process (PID 1). When `init` later calls `wait()`, it reaps the zombie, freeing its entry.\
    

> **Key insight**: Zombies exist only briefly; they hold only a small kernel data structure until the parent acknowledges the child’s termination by calling `wait` or `waitpid` (or by indirect reaping via `init`).\

### (b) Function pointer declaration (2 marks)\

We need a variable `fp` that points to a function of type `int foo(char *)`. The general syntax for a function pointer is:

```c
return_type (*pointer_name)(parameter_types);
```

Thus, for a function taking `char *` and returning `int`, we write:

```c
int (*fp)(char *);
```

- `fp` is the pointer’s name.
    
- Parentheses around `*fp` are required so the `*` binds to `fp`, not to the return type.\
    

### (c) `extern` variables (1 mark)\

The `extern` keyword in C declares that a variable is defined in another translation unit (source file), rather than creating storage itself. Thus:

- **True**: `extern` indicates the variable is defined elsewhere.
    
- **False**: It does _not_ require an initializer at the point of declaration.
    
- **False**: It does _not_ prevent access by other files once linked; it merely refers to the same symbol.
    
- **False**: An `extern` declaration does _not_ allocate storage—it only references it.\
    

### (d) Safe macro definitions (1 mark)\

Valid, safe macro definitions must follow the pattern:

```c
#define NAME replacement_text
```

- `#define COURSE = 209;` is invalid because macros should not include `=`.
    
- `#define COURSE 209;` incorrectly leaves a trailing semicolon in expansions.
    
- `#define COURSE = 209` leaves an unwanted `=` in expansions.
    
- **Correct**: `#define COURSE 209` ensures that every occurrence of `COURSE` is replaced by `209` with no extraneous characters.\

## Question 2 (3 marks)\

Consider the program that forks and uses `execlp` and `wait`.

```c
int main() {
  pid_t pid = fork();
  if (pid == 0) {
    printf("A\n");
    execlp("echo", "echo", "B", NULL);
    printf("C\n");
  } else {
    wait(NULL);
    printf("D\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

### (a) Output behavior (2 marks)\

- **`A` is printed in the child** before the `execlp` call.
    
- **`execlp` replaces the child’s code** with the `echo` program; on success, it does _not_ return, so `printf("C\n")` executes only if `execlp` fails.
    
- The `echo B` invocation prints `B`.
    
- The parent’s `wait(NULL)` blocks until the child (whether replaced or error) terminates, then `printf("D\n")` executes in the parent.
    

Thus:

- Only `A` and `B` are guaranteed in the child; `C` appears _only on execlp failure_.
    
- `D` is printed after the child exits, assuming the child terminates before the parent’s `printf`.
    

### (b) Compilation commands (1 mark)\

Given `a.c` with a prototype `int f();` and `main` calling `f`, we consider:

- `gcc -Wall -g -o a a.c`: **fails** linking (no definition of `f`).
    
- **`gcc -Wall -g -c a.c`**: compiles to `a.o` without linking—OK.
    
- `gcc -g a.c`: links and emits errors (undefined `f`).
    
- **`gcc -c a.c`**: compiles to `a.o` without warnings if prototypes are allowed—OK.

## Question 3 (5 marks) Makefile rules and dependencies\

Files: `Makefile`, `network.c`, `processor.c`, `utils.c`, `utils.h`.  
Makefile builds two targets: `datap` and `netc`, each linking their `.o` files.

### (a) `make utils.o` creates `utils.o`. (1 mark)\

- It reads line 15–16 rule: compiles `utils.c` (depends on `utils.h`) into `utils.o`.\
    

### (b) After that, `make` (default `all`) builds both `datap` and `netc`: (1 mark)

1. **`processor.o`**: compiles `processor.c` using rule line 9–10.
    
2. **`network.o`**: compiles `network.c` using rule line 12–13.
    
3. **`datap`**: links `processor.o utils.o` via line 3–4.
    
4. **`netc`**: links `network.o utils.o` via line 6–7.\
    

### (c) Edit `network.c` and `make all`: (1 mark)

- `network.o` is out-of-date, so it is recompiled.
    
- `netc` must be relinked to include the new `network.o`.
    
- **`utils.o`**, **`processor.o`**, and **`datap`** remain unchanged if their dependencies are unmodified.
    

Thus: **`network.o`** and **`netc`** are modified.\

### (d) Extending with `helper.c` and `helper.h`: (2 marks)\

1. **New file**: `helper.c` and its header `helper.h`.
    
2. **New object**: `helper.o` must be built from `helper.c`:
    
    ```make
    helper.o: helper.c helper.h
     	 gcc -Wall -g -c helper.c
    ```
    
3. **Dependency update**: `processor.c` now includes `helper.h`, so the `processor.o` rule must reflect this:
    
    ```make
    processor.o: processor.c utils.h helper.h
     	 gcc -Wall -g -c processor.c
    ```
    
4. **Linking**: `datap` must now depend on `helper.o`. Update line 3 to:
    
    ```make
    datap: processor.o utils.o helper.o
     	 gcc -Wall -g -o datap processor.o utils.o helper.o
    ```
    

No other changes are needed for `netc`.

> **Principle**: Every source file’s rule must list _all_ its `.h` dependencies, and every executable’s rule must list _all_ its `.o` files.\

## Question 4 (6 marks) Forks, process trees, and output ordering\

```c
int main() {
  pid_t r = fork();           // (1)
  if (r > 0) {
    fprintf(stderr, "A");  // (2)
    r = fork();              // (3)
    if (r == 0) {
      fprintf(stderr, "B"); // (4)
      exit(3);
    }
    int status;
    if (wait(&status) != -1) {
      if (WIFEXITED(status)) {
        fprintf(stderr, "%d", WEXITSTATUS(status)); // (5)
      }
    }
    fprintf(stderr, "E");  // (6)
  } else {
    fprintf(stderr, "C");  // (7)
  }
  fprintf(stderr, "D");    // (8)
  return 4;
}
```

### (a) Number of processes (1 mark)\

- **Original**: P0 (runs `main`).
    
- **First fork** at (1) spawns child P1.
    
- **In P0**, `r > 0`, so second fork at (3) spawns P2.
    
- **In P1**, `r == 0` at (1), so it does _not_ perform the second fork.
    

Total: **3 processes** (P0, P1, P2).\

### (b) Characters after shell prompt (1 mark)\

After processes exit, any writes to `stderr` that occur after the shell prompt appears will show up on the terminal. Only processes that continue past the prompt-printing will do so.\

- **P1** (first child) prints `C` at (7), then falls through to (8) and prints `D`, then returns. Because it never waits, it may finish _after_ the shell prompt.
    
- **P2** (second child of P0) prints `B` at (4), then calls `exit(3)`, skipping (8). However, its `fprintf` may occur after the shell prompt.
    
- **P0** prints all its output (`A`, status digit, `E`, then `D`) before it returns; typically this occurs before the shell prompt.
    

Thus, characters that _might_ appear after the prompt are: **`C`, `D`, and `B`** (in various orders).\

### (c) True/False (4 marks)\

1. **"The value printed on line 13 can be 3 or 4."**
    
    - _False._ Only the exit code of P2 (line 8’s `exit(3)`) reaches the `wait` in P0, so `WEXITSTATUS(status)` is always `3`. P0’s own `return 4` does not affect this `wait`.
        
2. **"C can be printed before A."**
    
    - _True._ P1’s `fprintf(stderr, "C")` occurs in parallel with P0’s `fprintf(stderr, "A")`. With scheduling, P1 may reach (7) and print `C` before P0 reaches (2) and prints `A`.
        
3. **"A can be printed last."**
    
    - _False._ `A` is printed early in P0 before the second `fork`; other outputs from both children can occur later, but P0’s `A` happens immediately after the first `fork`.
        
4. **"B can be printed first."**
    
    - _True._ P2 executes the second child’s `fprintf(stderr, "B")` immediately after the second `fork`; if scheduling delays P0 and P1, B may appear before any other character.\

## Question 5 (6 marks) Reading binary data and counting flags\

```c
struct data {
  int flag;
  double bias;
  char info[128];
};

int count_flags(char *filename, int flag) {
  FILE *fp = fopen(filename, "rb");
  int len;
  fread(&len, sizeof(int), 1, fp);
  int count = 0;
  struct data elem;
  for (int i = 0; i < len; ++i) {
    fread(&elem, sizeof(struct data), 1, fp);
    if (elem.flag == flag) count++;
  }
  fclose(fp);
  return count;
}
```

**Explanation**:

1. **Open file** in binary mode (`"rb"`) so that no translation of newline or other characters occurs.
    
2. **Read length**: The file begins with an `int` indicating the number of `struct data` elements stored. `fread(&len, sizeof(int), 1, fp)` reads exactly one integer.
    
3. **Iterate**: Loop from `0` to `len-1`.
    
4. **Read each record**: `fread(&elem, sizeof(struct data), 1, fp)` loads the next record’s bytes into `elem`.
    
5. **Check flag**: Compare `elem.flag` to the function parameter `flag`. If equal, increment `count`.
    
6. **Close file**: Always `fclose(fp)` to flush internal buffers and release resources.
    
7. **Return** the total matching count.
    

> **Key points**: Proper binary reading order and consistent use of `sizeof` guarantee correct parsing. No error checks are needed per problem statement.
