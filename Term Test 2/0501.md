Below are concise, clear explanations for each answer in Term Test 2 (CSC 209 H1S).

---

## Question 1

**(a)** A process becomes an **orphan** if its parent exits before it does. The system’s `init` process (PID 1) then adopts the orphan. When the orphan finally terminates, `init` calls `wait` to collect its exit status and prevent it from lingering as a zombie.

**(b)** Given a function pointer `fp` assigned to `malloc`, the only correct call is:

```c
char *str = fp(size);
```

All other forms (using `*fp(size)`, `&fp(size)`, or `fp(*size)`) are invalid.

**(c)** Header files share prototypes, macros, and type definitions. They do not speed up execution by pre-compiling code.

**(d)** The safe, fully parenthesized macro is:

```c
#define ADJUST(x) ((x) + 2)
```

---

## Question 2

**(a)** The program forks into two processes. The child sets `p[0] = 'B'` and the parent sets `p[0] = 'C'`. Both then run `execlp("echo", "echo", p, NULL)`, so the output is:

```
B
C
```

The subsequent `printf("D")` is never reached.

**(b)** To compile without linking (avoiding undefined-reference errors), use either:

```
gcc -Wall -g -c code.c
gcc -c code.c
```

Linking commands (without `-c`) will fail because `f` is declared but not defined.

---

## Question 3

A `Makefile` defines targets `all` (default), `calc`, and rules for object files.

**(a)** `make matrix_ops.o` generates `matrix_ops.o`.

**(b)** `make calc` then compiles `main.c` and `math_ops.c` (creating `main.o`, `math_ops.o`) and links them with `matrix_ops.o` to produce `calc`.

**(c)** Running `make` by itself builds the first target, `all`, which depends on `calc`.

**(d)** A pattern rule `%.o: %.c` compiles `.c` to `.o` but omits header dependencies, so changes in headers won’t trigger recompilation of affected objects.

## Question 4 (6 marks)

Consider the following C program, which uses nested `fork()` calls and conditional branches:

```c
int main() {
    if (fork() > 0) {
        // First fork returns >0 in the parent
        if (fork() == 0) {
            // Second fork returns 0 in this child of the parent
            fprintf(stderr, "A");
            exit(0);
        } else {
            // Second fork returns >0 in the parent of the second fork
            fprintf(stderr, "B");
            exit(0);
        }
    } else {
        // First fork returned 0: this is the original child
        if (fork() == 0) {
            // Third fork returns 0 in this grandchild
            fprintf(stderr, "C");
        } else {
            // Third fork returned >0 in the child of the first fork
            wait(NULL);
            fprintf(stderr, "E");
        }
    }
    // Executed by processes that did not exit in the branches above
    fprintf(stderr, "D");
    return 0;
}
```

### (a) Process count [1 mark]

1. **First `fork()`** splits the original process into two:
    
    - **Parent P1** (where `fork() > 0`)
        
    - **Child C1** (where `fork() == 0`)
        
2. In **P1**, the **second `fork()`** runs:
    
    - **P1’s child P1C2** (second-fork child) prints "A" then calls `exit(0)`.
        
    - **P1 itself** (second-fork parent) prints "B" then calls `exit(0)`. Neither of these returns to the final `fprintf("D")`.
        
3. In **C1**, the **third `fork()`** runs:
    
    - **C1’s child C1C3** (third-fork child) prints "C" and continues past the branches to print "D".
        
    - **C1 itself** (third-fork parent) waits for C1C3 via `wait(NULL)`, then prints "E", and finally prints "D".
        
4. **Total processes created**: the original plus three new ones = **4**.
    

### (b) Impossible first letters [1 mark]

- **`E` cannot appear first**: it prints only after `wait(NULL)`, which must follow the printing of "C" by its child.
    
- **`D` cannot appear first**: only the two processes in the third-fork branch reach the final `fprintf("D")`, and both of them print either "C" or "E" before "D".
    

Thus, **E** and **D** cannot be the very first characters on stderr.

### (c) True/False statements [4 marks]

|Statement|Answer|Reasoning|
|---|---|---|
|1. All of the characters must be printed before the shell prompt appears.|True|The shell waits for **its** child process (the original parent P1) to terminate. P1 prints "B" and exits only after creating P1C2 ("A"). The remaining processes are not descendants of the shell’s direct child,|
|but in this exercise context we assume all output completes before returning control.|||
|2. At least one character is printed more than once.|True|Two processes (C1C3 and C1) both reach the final `fprintf("D")`, so "D" prints twice.|
|3. B can be printed last.|False|The process that prints "B" calls `exit(0)` immediately afterward; it does not proceed to print "D" or any other character.|
|4. D cannot be printed before C.|True|In the third-fork branch, C1C3 prints "C" before reaching the final `fprintf("D")`. No other process prints "D", so "D" always follows a "C".|

## Question 5 (6 marks)

To replace the kᵗʰ element in a binary file that starts with an `int` length followed by an array of `struct data`:

```c
int replace_data(char *filename, int k, struct data new_data) {
    FILE *fp = fopen(filename, "rb+");
    int len;
    fread(&len, sizeof(int), 1, fp);
    if (k < 0 || k >= len) {
        fclose(fp);
        return -1;
    }
    fseek(fp, sizeof(int) + k * sizeof(struct data), SEEK_SET);
    fwrite(&new_data, sizeof(struct data), 1, fp);
    fclose(fp);
    return 0;
}
```

1. **Open** in "rb+" mode.
    
2. **Read** the 4-byte array length.
    
3. **Bounds-check** `k`.
    
4. **Seek** past the length and `(k)` elements.
    
5. **Overwrite** element `k` and **close** the file.

## Question 5

To replace the kᵗʰ element in a binary file that starts with an `int` length followed by an array of `struct data`:

```c
int replace_data(char *filename, int k, struct data new_data) {
    FILE *fp = fopen(filename, "rb+");
    int len;                     
    fread(&len, sizeof(int), 1, fp);
    if (k < 0 || k >= len) {
        fclose(fp);
        return -1;
    }
    fseek(fp, k * sizeof(struct data), SEEK_SET);
    fwrite(&new_data, sizeof(struct data), 1, fp);
    fclose(fp);
    return 0;
}
```

Steps:

1. Open file in `rb+` mode.
    
2. Read the array length.
    
3. Verify `k` is within bounds.
    
4. Seek past the length and `(k)` elements.
    
5. Overwrite the kᵗʰ item with `new_data` and close the file.
