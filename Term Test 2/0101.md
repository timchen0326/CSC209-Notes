Below is a detailed, step‑by‑step explanation of every solution in the Term Test 2 answers. I’ve restated each part of the question, given the correct answer, and then unpacked **why** that answer holds. All references are to the official solutions document.

## Question 1: Blocking calls, function pointers, `#include`, and macro functions

### 1(a) Example of a blocking library or system call

**Answer:**

- **`read()`** can block when there’s no data available on its file descriptor. It unblocks as soon as data arrives (e.g., when another process writes to the descriptor).
    
- **`wait()`** blocks when there are no child processes that have exited yet; it unblocks when one of the process’s children terminates.
    

**Why?**

- **`read(fd, buf, n)`** will cause the calling process to sleep if `fd` refers to, say, a pipe or socket with no incoming data. The kernel keeps the process off the CPU until data becomes available, at which point it wakes the process, fills `buf`, and returns the number of bytes read.
    
- **`wait(&status)`** causes the parent process to sleep until one of its child processes changes state (typically by exiting). The kernel records the child’s exit code in `status` and wakes the parent so it can reap the child.

### 1(b) Declaring a function‑pointer to a function taking an `int` and returning a `double`

**Correct declaration:**

```c
double (*fp)(int);
```

**Why the others are wrong:**

- `double *fp(int);` declares **`fp`** as a function returning `double*`, not a pointer to function.
    
- `(*fp)(int) double;` is syntactically invalid.
    
- `int fp(double *);` declares a function named `fp` taking a `double*` and returning `int`.
    

Function‑pointer syntax always places the asterisk inside the parentheses:

```c
return_type (*pointer_name)(parameter_types);
```

### 1(c) Angle brackets versus quotes in `#include`

**Answer:**

> Angle brackets (`<…>`) are used for **standard/library** headers; quotes (`"…"`) are for **user‑defined** headers.

**Why?**

- When you write `#include <stdio.h>`, the preprocessor searches only in the system include directories.
    
- With `#include "myheader.h"`, it first looks in your project’s directory (or the directory of the including file), then falls back to the system directories if not found.
    

---

### 1(d) Reasons to use **macro functions** over regular C functions

**Correct reasons:**

1. **Type‑generic flexibility:** macros operate on any type (they perform textual substitution), unlike functions which require specific types.
    
2. **Eliminated call overhead:** macros expand inline, so there’s no cost of pushing a new stack frame or performing a function call at runtime.
    

**Why not debugging or stacks?**

- Macros can actually **hinder** debugging, since errors point to the expanded code, not the macro definition.
    
- They do **not** create new stack frames—that’s precisely why they’re faster.

## Question 2: `fork()`, `execl()`, and header‑variable definitions

### 2(a) What the program prints

```c
if (fork() == 0) {
    printf("Running ls -l\n");
    execl("/bin/ls","ls","-l",NULL);
    exit(42);
} else {
    int status;
    wait(&status);
    if (WIFEXITED(status))
        printf("Exit %d\n", WEXITSTATUS(status));
}
```

**Printed output:**

1. `Running ls -l`
    
2. _(the directory listing from `ls -l`)_
    
3. `Exit 0`
    

**Why?**

- The **child** prints **“Running ls -l”**, then `execl(...)` replaces the child’s process image with `/bin/ls`. If `execl` succeeds, `exit(42)` is never reached.
    
- When `/bin/ls` finishes, it returns **status 0** to the kernel.
    
- The **parent** waits in `wait(&status)` until the child exits; `WIFEXITED(status)` is true, and `WEXITSTATUS(status)` yields **0**, so it prints **“Exit 0”**.

### 2(b) Fixing multiple‑definition of a global variable

Given `defns.h` contains:

```c
int global_var = 0;
```

and both `a.c` and `b.c` include it, you get a link‑time error.

**Correct fix:**

> In `defns.h`, change the definition to:
> 
> ```c
> extern int global_var;
> ```
> 
> Then in **one** `.c` file (e.g., `a.c`), add:
> 
> ```c
> int global_var = 0;
> ```

**Why?**

- `extern int global_var;` tells each `.c` file that **the** variable is defined elsewhere. Only one actual definition (with initialization) must exist across the program.

## Question 3: Makefile dependencies and phony targets

Makefile:

```make
all: program

program: main.o utils.o helper.o
    gcc -Wall -g -o program main.o utils.o helper.o

main.o: main.c utils.h helper.h
    gcc -Wall -g -c main.c

utils.o: utils.c utils.h
    gcc -Wall -g -c utils.c

helper.o: helper.c helper.h
    gcc -Wall -c helper.c

clean:
    rm -f *.o program
```

### 3(a) Running `make utils.o`

**Actions:**

```bash
gcc -Wall -g -c utils.c
```

### 3(b) Then running `make`

**Actions (in order):**

1. `gcc -Wall -g -c main.c`
    
2. `gcc -Wall -c helper.c`
    
3. `gcc -Wall -g -o program main.o utils.o helper.o`
    

### 3(c) After editing `helper.c`, then `make program`

**Files rebuilt:**

- `helper.o`
    
- `program`
    

### 3(d) What is a PHONY target?

A **phony** target is one that does **not** correspond to an actual file. Make will always execute its recipe, even if a file of the same name exists. Common examples: `clean`, `all`, `install`.

### 3(e) Phony targets in this Makefile

> `all` and `clean`

## Question 4: Tracing multiple `fork()`s and output ordering

We have this program:

```c
int main() {
    if (fork() == 0) {                   // Branch A: code executed by Child #1
        if (fork() == 0) {               // Branch B: code executed by Grandchild
            fprintf(stderr, "A");
            exit(3);
        } else {                         // Branch C: code executed by Child #1 (after second fork)
            fprintf(stderr, "B");
            exit(2);
        }
    } else {                             // Branch D: code executed by the Original Parent
        int status;
        fprintf(stderr, "C");
        if (wait(&status) != -1 && WIFEXITED(status)) {
            fprintf(stderr, "%d", WEXITSTATUS(status));
        }
    }
    fprintf(stderr, "D");
    return 0;
}
```

### Process creation and hierarchy

1. **Original Parent (P0)** starts executing `main()`.
    
2. **First** `**fork()**` at line 2:
    
    - Returns **0** in the **Child #1 (P1)**.
        
    - Returns **child PID** (non-zero) in **Original Parent (P0)**.
        
3. **In Child #1 (P1)** we hit **second** `**fork()**` at line 3:
    
    - Returns **0** in the **Grandchild (P2)**.
        
    - Returns **grandchild PID** in **Child #1 (P1)**.
        
4. **Total processes**: P0, P1, and P2 ⇒ **3 processes** (Part 4a).
    

```
        P0 (original)
        / \
     fork   \
      /      \
    P1        (parent continues)
    |
   fork
    |
   P2
```

### Which process prints which letters?

- **Grandchild (P2)** executes the inner `if (fork()==0)` true branch:
    
    - Prints **"A"** to `stderr`.
        
    - Calls `exit(3)` immediately after.
        
- **Child #1 (P1)** executes the `else` branch of the inner `if`:
    
    - Prints **"B"** to `stderr`.
        
    - Calls `exit(2)`, terminating this process.
        
- **Original Parent (P0)** executes the outer `else`:
    
    1. Prints **"C"** to `stderr`.
        
    2. Calls `wait(&status)`, which **reaps** the termination of P1 and retrieves its exit code.
        
    3. Since `WIFEXITED(status)` is true, prints **"2"** (`WEXITSTATUS(status)`).
        
- **Only P0** reaches the final `fprintf(stderr,"D")` because P1 and P2 have already called `exit()`. Thus, **"D"** appears exactly once, from P0.
    

### Part 4(a): Counting processes

- **3 processes** total: Original Parent (P0), Child #1 (P1), and Grandchild (P2).
    

### Part 4(b): What does line 15 print?

- `**2**`: P0’s `wait(&status)` reaps P1, whose call to `exit(2)` makes `WEXITSTATUS(status)` equal to `2`.
    

### Part 4(c): True/False analysis

| Statement                                                | True/False | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **“D will never be printed first.”**                     | **True**   | Only P0 prints “D” **after** printing “C”, waiting, and printing the exit code. Meanwhile, P1 or P2 may print “A” or “B” before P0 reaches its final `fprintf`, so “D” cannot be the first character on stderr.                        |
| **“D will always be printed last.”**                     | **False**  | Since `stderr` is unbuffered, P2’s “A” (or P1’s “B”) could execute **after** P0 prints “D”. In some schedules, the orphaned grandchild runs late, causing “A” to appear even after the program exits and control returns to the shell. |
| **“A could be printed after the shell prompt appears.”** | **True**   | P2 is never `wait()`‑ed by P0, and P1 exits immediately. Therefore, P2 can outlive P0 and print “A” after P0’s exit, potentially after the shell prompt.                                                                               |
| **“C will always be printed before B.”**                 | **False**  | There is no synchronization between P0 and P1 for those prints. The scheduler may run P1 first, printing “B” before P0 prints “C”. Scheduling nondeterminism means no guaranteed ordering across separate processes.                   |

## Question 5: Implementing `get_element`

```c
int get_element(char *filename, int r, int c) {
    FILE *fp = fopen(filename, "rb");        // open for binary
    int height, width;
    fread(&height, sizeof(int), 1, fp);      // rows
    fread(&width,  sizeof(int), 1, fp);      // cols

    // skip (r*width + c) integers
    fseek(fp, (r * width + c) * sizeof(int), SEEK_CUR);

    int val;
    fread(&val, sizeof(int), 1, fp);         // read desired element
    fclose(fp);
    return val;
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. Read the two header ints (rows, cols).
    
2. Use `fseek(..., SEEK_CUR)` to skip directly to the requested entry without reading intervening data.
    
3. Read exactly one `int`—the element at `(r,c)`—and return it.
    

This meets the requirement to “not read unnecessary data.”
